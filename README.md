# Assembly Languages and Architectures Exploration

Welcome to the Assembly Languages and Architectures Exploration repository! This is my private project aimed at exploring various assembly languages, computer architectures, embedded systems, and operating system specifications. The goal is to enhance knowledge in low-level programming and related fields.

## Project Description

This repository is focused on the exploration and learning of assembly languages, computer architectures, and related subjects through the Netwide Assembler Compiler NASM and GCC

## Roadmap

Here's our roadmap for what's already been accomplished and what is planned to explore in the future:

### Accomplished
- [x] Introduction to x86_64 assembly language.
- [x] Basic assembly language programming exercises.
- [x] Learning about the x86_64 architecture.
- [x] Intel and AT&T ASM Syntaxes

### In Progress
- [ ] Deep dive into x86_64 assembly language, including advanced concepts.
- [ ] Exploring ARM assembly and embedded systems.

### Future Goals
- [ ] Investigating other assembly languages and architectures.
- [ ] Study and experiment with operating system internals.
